# Project 3: A Visualization of Arizona National Parks
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map of the national parks in Arizona (Grand Canyon National Park, Petrified Forest National Park, and Saguaro National Park) and analyze various aspects of these parks such as available amentities, common activities, and distribution, location, and reservation status of campgrounds. This project was written in JavaScript and uses the D3, Leaflet, and Chart.js libraries to create the visualizations. 

## How to Use
To view the visualizations, navigate to the mappingRJ_JK.html webpage for the interactive map, and the [INSERT DANIEL AND DAVID'S WEBPAGE HERE] for the charts. The map has three layers: 
1. Amenitiies
   * When an amenities marker is clicked, a scrollable popup will appear that lists all of the amenities available at that park
2. Activities
   * When an activities marker is clicked, a scrollable popup will appear that lists all of the activities availanle at that park
3. Campgrounds
   * When a campground marker is clicked, a popup will appear that lists the name of the campground, how many reservable vs first come first serve campsites are available, and a description of the campground

## Ethical Considerations
The dataset used is an open source API from the National Parks Service. There is no sensitive or personally-identifying information provided for any persons in the available data. In order to use the API, you will need to register for an API key. This requires you to provide your first name, last name, and email address (where you will receive your key). It is not clear how the NPS uses the first and last name information once you have received your key.
